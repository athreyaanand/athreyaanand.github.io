            The FCC is set to eliminate a Biden-era rule that required Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to disclose all fees to consumers due to complaints from ISPs about the complexity of listing every fee.

            The research paper titled "TaTToo: Tool-Grounded Thinking PRM for Test-Time Scaling in Tabular Reasoning" by Jiaru Zou, Soumya Roy, Vinay Kumar Verma, and others introduces a new approach using Process Reward Models (PRMs) to enhance the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in tabular reasoning domains. PRMs are shown to be effective in supervising LRMs during test-time scaling (TTS), offering a promising method for improving reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. This research sheds light on the potential of PRMs in optimizing LRMs for tabular reasoning tasks, opening up new possibilities for advancing reasoning models in various applications.

            The research paper introduces DropD-SLAM, a monocular SLAM system that achieves RGB-D-level accuracy without using depth sensors. Instead of depth input, the system utilizes three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation network. This innovation could potentially reduce the cost and complexity of SLAM systems by eliminating the need for depth sensors while maintaining accuracy.

            The research paper introduces Human3R, a novel feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike traditional methods, Human3R offers a unified approach that eliminates the need for multi-stage pipelines and iterative refinement, making it more efficient and versatile for real-time applications. This advancement could significantly impact fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction by enabling more seamless and accurate reconstruction of humans within dynamic scenes.

            The article highlights the growing issue of scam calls and texts in America, exacerbated by President Trump's recent veto of a bill aimed at combating robocalls. The vetoed bill, the TRACED Act, would have increased penalties for illegal robocallers and required phone companies to implement call authentication technology. This move is expected to prolong the battle against fraudulent calls and texts plaguing consumers and businesses.
